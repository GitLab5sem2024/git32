        <h2>About Sourav</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, I'm Sourav, a 20-year-old cricketer with a deep passion for the game and an equal enthusiasm for game development. While I spend most of my time on the field, hitting boundaries and taking wickets, I also dedicate a portion of my day to learning and experimenting with game design. The world of coding and game creation excites me as much as a thrilling cricket match. Through this blog, I aim to share my journey in both sports and game development.
